Description:
In this project, I developed a deep learning model to perform sentiment analysis on IMDB movie reviews. 
The objective was to classify reviews as positive or negative based on their textual content. 
Key highlights of the project include:

ðŸ“Œ Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and tokenized large volumes of textual data to prepare it for model training.

ðŸ“Œ Model Development: Built and trained a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network using TensorFlow/Keras to capture the sequential nature of text data.

ðŸ“Œ Embedding Layer: Integrated word embeddings to transform textual input into dense vector representations for improved model learning.

ðŸ“Œ Model Evaluation: Achieved high accuracy and F1-score by fine-tuning hyperparameters and implementing techniques like dropout to prevent overfitting.

ðŸ“Œ Result Interpretation: Analyzed model performance through confusion matrices and classification reports to ensure robust sentiment prediction.

This project enhanced my skills in Natural Language Processing (NLP), deep learning, and model optimization, and strengthened my ability to work on real-world text classification problems.
